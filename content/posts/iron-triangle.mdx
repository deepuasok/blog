Every product manager learns this lesson eventually, usually the hard way.

This isn't cynicism. It's physics. Resources are finite. Time is finite. And quality is the emergent property of how you allocate both.

## The Tradeoffs

Play with this. Move the sliders. Watch what happens.

The math is unforgiving. When you push one lever up, something else has to give. The only question is whether you're making that tradeoff consciously or letting it happen to you.

## Why This Matters

Early in my career, I thought good PMs found ways around this constraint. They didn't. They just got better at:

1. **Making the tradeoff explicit** — Everyone knows what we're sacrificing
2. **Choosing the right sacrifice** — Based on what actually matters right now
3. **Communicating it clearly** — No surprises when quality dips or timelines slip

Here's a simple way to think about it in code:

```python
def ship_product(speed: int, quality: int, cost: int) -> str:
    budget = 150  # You only get 150 points total

    if speed + quality + cost > budget:
        return "Something's gotta give."

    return "Ship it."
```

## The Liberating Part

Once you accept you can't have everything, you stop agonizing over impossible choices. You start asking better questions:

- What's the *actual* constraint right now?
- Which tradeoff will hurt least?
- What would we do if we had to ship in half the time?

The iron triangle isn't a prison. It's a forcing function for clarity.
