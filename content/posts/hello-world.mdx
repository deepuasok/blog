I've started blogs before. They always died the same way—I'd over-engineer the platform, obsess over the design, and never actually write anything.

This time is different. This site is aggressively minimal. There's nothing to fiddle with. No analytics to check. No comments to moderate. Just a text editor and a publish button.

## What I'll Write About

Mostly product management. The craft of it. The tradeoffs. The conversations you have in rooms where decisions get made.

> "The best product managers I know are great writers. They think in narratives, not bullet points."

Also: career strategy, building things, and whatever else I'm thinking about.

## The Format

Some posts will be long essays. Some will be short notes—things I learned, observations, half-formed ideas I want to capture before they disappear.

No publishing schedule. No metrics. Just writing when I have something to say.

Let's see where this goes.
